# Machine Learning Covid 19 project

### Project Overview

The Data is related to the ICU visit Prediction during COVID 19. The HOSPITAL is SÍRIO-LIBANÊS in Brazil one of the countries most 
affected by the COVID 19 pandemic with more than 16 million confirmed cases and 454 429 confirmed deaths as of May 26, 2021.we will use 
Machine Learning ML to help reduce the strain on hospital's ICU beds, where the objective is to develop a ML model to predict if a 
patient of a confirmed COVID-19 case will require admission to the ICU.

### Data Sources

Covid 19 project : The primary Dataset use for this analysis is the '/content/Kaggle_Sirio_Libanes_ICU_Prediction (1).xlsx' files , 
containing detailed informations about each covid 19 case in the Sirio Libanes ICU in Brazil.

### Tools 

- Excel [Downlaod here] (https://kaggle.com)
- Colab - Data Analysis

### Data Cleanin and Preparation

In the initial data preparation we performed the following tasks:
1.Data loading and inspection,
2.Handling missing values, 
3.Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the data to answer a key question such as :

Can we  develop a ML model to predict if a patient of a confirmed COVID-19 case will require admission to the ICU.
